## Game Flow

### Round Structure
The game is played over a maximum of 12 Rounds. Each Round consists of:
1. **Recharge Phase**: Both players may flip 1 inactive token to active
2. **Player Turns**: Each player takes one turn per round

### Turn Structure
Each turn consists of **3 Actions** (except First Player's first turn = 2 Actions).

**Special Note**: Starting at Round 8, each turn consists of **4 Actions** instead of 3.

---

## Actions

On your turn, you must take all available actions. Each action can be one of the following:

### Action 1: Move a Token
Move one of your tokens on the battlefield one space in any direction.

**Standard Movement Rules**:
- Move one adjacent hex space in any direction
- Cannot move through occupied spaces (unless specified by Special Move)
- Cannot move onto spaces occupied by your own tokens
- Can move onto spaces occupied by enemy tokens (does not trigger combat automatically)

**Special Moves** (listed on specific Ally cards):
- Some Allies have enhanced movement ranges or special movement rules
- Special Moves override standard movement rules where specified

### Action 2: Deploy a Token
Deploy an Ally from your card area onto the battlefield.

**Deploy Steps**:
1. **Pay Deploy Cost**: Flip active tokens (ally name showing) to inactive side ("Flip to Recharge" showing)
   - Deploy costs range from 1-3 tokens as shown in the lower right corner of each Ally card
   - Can flip any combination of active tokens (Allies or Troops)
2. **Place Token**: Put the deployed Ally token on one of your unoccupied Deploy spaces (light gray hexes)

**Deploy Rules**:
- Can only deploy to your own Deploy spaces
- Deploy space must be unoccupied
- Deployed token starts as active
- Choose carefully which tokens to flip for payment vs which to deploy

### Action 3: Declare Battle
Initiate combat between tokens in adjacent hexes.

**Battle Eligibility**:
- Only tokens in adjacent hexes can battle
- Active player chooses which battles to resolve and in what order if multiple skirmishes are possible
- Tokens with Ranged Attack (if specified on card) can attack non-adjacent targets

---

## Combat Resolution

### Combat Steps

1. **Identify Participants**: All eligible tokens in the battle area
2. **Calculate Attacks**: Each token's Attack value vs opponent's Defeat value
3. **Apply Damage & Eliminate Defeated Tokens**

### Combat Rules

**Attack Distribution**:
- A token can only attack tokens in adjacent hex spaces (unless Ranged Attack ability)
- Attack points are distributed to tokens with **lowest Defeat values first**
- If a token is defeated and the attacker has remaining Attack value, excess Attack distributes to the next eligible token with the lowest Defeat value
- If multiple of your tokens can attack, you choose which token distributes Attack in which order

**Token Elimination**:
- When a token's Defeat value is met or exceeded by incoming Attack, it is eliminated
- Eliminated tokens are removed from the battlefield and placed inactive (face down) on their card

**Example Combat**:
- Token A (Attack 5) attacks Token B (Defeat 2) and Token C (Defeat 4)
- Token B is defeated first (5 - 2 = 3 remaining)
- Token C takes 3 damage but survives (needs 4 to defeat)

---

## Recharging Tokens

### Standard Recharge (Start of Each Round)
Both players may flip **1 token** from inactive to active on their character cards.

### Gate/Bridge Control Bonus
At the **end of your turn**, if you control the Gate/Bridge hexes (4 dark gray center hexes):
- You may flip **1 inactive token to active**
- Control = having more tokens on Gate/Bridge hexes than your opponent

### Special Recharge Abilities
Some Ally cards grant additional recharge abilities (e.g., Mammon)

---

## Ally Abilities

### Ability Activation
- An Ally's ability is **only active when that Ally token is on the battlefield**
- Abilities apply as long as the Ally remains on the battlefield
- If an Ally is eliminated, its ability is lost

### Ability Types
- **Special Move**: Enhanced movement capabilities
- **Triggered Ability**: Activates at specific times (start of round, end of move, etc.)
- **Passive Ability**: Continuous effect (stat boosts, etc.)
- **Win Condition**: Alternative victory condition

---

## Commander Abilities

### One-Time Commander Ability
Each Commander (Michael and Lucifer) has an **extra action** ability that can be used **once per game**:

**Ability**: Move one of your Troops or Allies on the battlefield to an adjacent space next to your Commander

**Rules**:
- This is an extra action (does not count against your 3 actions per turn)
- Can only be used once per game
- A marker on the Commander card is removed upon use to track this
- If both players use this ability simultaneously (unclear timing), the non-active player places first, then the active player

---

## Victory Conditions

### Primary Victory Condition
**Defeat the opponent's Commander**

### Alternative Victory Conditions
Some Ally cards provide alternative win conditions:

**Angels**:
- **Zadkiel**: Win if you control all 4 Pearly Gates spaces (Gate/Bridge hexes)

**Demons**:
- **Beelzebub**: Win if all of your Allies are on the battlefield simultaneously

### Game End by Round Limit
If no victory condition is met by the end of **Round 12**:
1. **Primary Tiebreaker**: Player with the most Allies on the battlefield wins
2. **Secondary Tiebreaker**: Player with the most total tokens on the battlefield wins

---

## Special Rules & Clarifications

### Gate/Bridge Spaces (Pearly Gates)
- The 4 dark gray hexes in the center of the board
- Control is determined by token count (more tokens = control)
- Some Allies cannot move onto or past these spaces (Camiel, Asmodeus)

### Deploy Spaces
- The 2 light gray hexes closest to each player
- Only that player can deploy to their own Deploy spaces
- Tokens can move off Deploy spaces normally
- Once a token moves off a Deploy space, that space can be used for another deployment

### Stacking Rules
- Multiple tokens cannot occupy the same hex
- Exception: Moving through occupied spaces (only with Special Move ability)

### Token Management
- Active tokens can be deployed or used for payment
- Inactive tokens cannot be deployed or used until recharged
- Tokens on the battlefield remain active unless eliminated

---

## Turn Progression Summary

### Each Round:
1. **Recharge Phase**: Both players flip 1 inactive token to active
2. **Player 1 Turn**: Takes 3 actions (4 actions from Round 8+)
3. **Player 2 Turn**: Takes 3 actions (4 actions from Round 8+)
4. **Check Victory Conditions**
5. **Advance Round Tracker**

### Special Cases:
- **Round 1, First Player**: Only 2 actions on first turn
- **Rounds 8-12**: 4 actions per turn instead of 3
- **End of Turn**: Check Gate/Bridge control for bonus recharge

---

## Strategy Notes

### Resource Management
- Balance between deploying Allies and keeping tokens active
- Paying deploy costs requires flipping tokens inactive, limiting battlefield presence
- High-cost Allies (cost 3) are powerful but expensive

### Board Control
- Control of Gate/Bridge hexes provides recharge advantage
- Deploy spaces are critical for bringing in reinforcements
- Positioning affects combat efficiency

### Ally Timing
- Each Ally changes the rules of the game
- Timing when to deploy specific Allies is crucial
- Some Allies combo well together (e.g., Gabriel + Troops)

### Multiple Win Conditions
- Traditional: Eliminate enemy Commander
- Alternative: Zadkiel (control Gates) or Beelzebub (all Allies deployed)
- May be easier to achieve alternative win condition than defeating Commander
